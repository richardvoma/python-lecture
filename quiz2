#Propose a program to calculate Simple Interest

#Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100 Where, P is the principal amount T is the time and R is the rate

#Take P, T and R as user inputs.

# Get user input for principal, time, and rate
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
time = float(input("Enter the time : "))
rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate: "))

# Calculate simple interest
simple_interest = (principal * time * rate) / 100

# get the result
print("Simple Interest is:=", simple_interest)
